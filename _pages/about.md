I have a Ph.D. in imaging and color science, i.e., traditional computer vision field. 

I am a machine learning engineer who worked in IT industry for five years and interested in wide range of data science projects.

I usually run proof-of-concept using platforms like TensorFlow, Keras, Pytorch, H2O and Databricks. I wrote Python/Java ML algorithms, and am familiar with different ML libraries, i.e., scikit-learn and Spark ML.

I also build few data pipelines using [Postgres](https://github.com/mzcolor001/Data-Engineer-Practice/tree/master/Data%20Modeling%20with%20Postgres)[Cassandra](https://github.com/mzcolor001/Data-Engineer-Practice/tree/master/Data%20Modeling%20with%20Apache%20Cassandra), [MongoDB](https://github.com/mzcolor001/BioTech-Consulting-Project), [Apache Spark, AWS S3, Redshift and Athena](https://github.com/mzcolor001/Data-Engineer-Practice/tree/master/Data%20Lakes%20with%20Spark).

I am interested in data science and data engineering as well.
