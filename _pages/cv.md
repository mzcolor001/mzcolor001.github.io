Education
======
* Ph.D in Imaging and Color Science, North Carolina State University

Work experience
======
Insight, Boston, MA
Data Engineering Fellow 
* Consulted with a biotech company to build a scalable pipeline for DNA sequence data.
* Collected data from Google Cloud, cleaned and extracted sample and experiment metadata.
* Utilized MongoDB to store, aggregate and query patient information and visualized the data with Dash. § Used Airflow to monitor and automate the whole pipeline, and sent monitoring information to users.
* Used AWS S3 as a staging area and Redshift as a data warehouse to implement an ETL pipeline.

Ricoh USA, Boulder, CO

Machine Learning Engineer 
* Led a mixed group of five mechanical engineers and four software engineers, generated business roadmap,
coached and mentored junior software engineers and coordinated product delivery.
* Developed and led a system automation project using an inline spectrophotometer and camera sensors to
fetch real-time images.
* Utilized machine learning, KNN to classify the paper type based on sixteen derived features and a small
dataset. The L1 regularization is applied to prevent overfitting and the accuracy is about 95% based on the
K-fold cross-validation.
* Utilized deep learning algorithm, VGG16 to automatically select the ROI (Region of Interest) in real time
image to detect image defects.

Staff Software Engineer
* Worked on developing the architecture and workflow for color and imaging quality for large-format printer servers which were based on Linux.
* Developed color and imaging functions for printers and monitors to reproduce images with high fidelity.
* Developed an automated quality assurance system utilizing an offline spectrophotomer. Automated the
process of scanning and saving images, modified the existing algorithm in the API to make it scan with less time, and ultimately improved the system performance to twice as fast as the previous design.
